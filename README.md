# Finger_count_usimg_OpenCV
This project uses OpenCV to count the number of fingers shown in a hand gesture captured by a webcam. The program processes the video feed, detects contours and convexity defects, and uses the cosine rule to count the number of visible fingers. It displays the count on the screen in real-time.
